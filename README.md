# i18n-postal-address
A JavaScript library to produce international postal addresses formatted by
region

### Why?

The great [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) is not available
on the web.

Need to present postal addresses for different regions worldwide stored in
individual parts (company name, address, postal code, city, county, country,
  ...).

### Inspiration

MSDN > ... > Globalization and Localization > [Appendix V International Address Formats](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc195167.aspx)

[Query Address Data](http://i18napis.appspot.com/address)
